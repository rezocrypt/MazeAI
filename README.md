# MazeAI 

This is a very simple neural-network perceptron that attempts to solve a maze. It is fully client-side, monotonic, and requires no server; everything runs in the browser. The project is intentionally small and minimal, created to demonstrate the basic principles of AI.

# Usage

Here are main functions described.

New Maze - Generates new random maze.
Reset Maze - Clears all steps done by the player and starts from the same clear maze.
Step - It does exactly one step suggested by neural network.
Try - Tries to solve the full maze (can take up to few seconds).
Learn - It was made for learning but it doesn't work yet.

Below buttons are weights which describe by neural network (I just tried some random ones and did very simple learning).
